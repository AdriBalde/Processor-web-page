			<h2>
				<a id="Definicion">Definition of the processor architecture:</a>
			</h2>

			<p>
				The architecture of a processor is basically the internal structure of this element.
				We are not talking about the shape and size, but about how the different logical
				and physical units that make up a processor are located, we are talking about the ALU, registers, Control Unit, etc.
				In this sense, there are currently two main types of architecture: CISC and RISC,
				two ways of working based on the architecture of Von Neuman, the person who invented the digital microprocessor in 1945.

				Although it is true that architecture does not only mean this,
				since nowadays manufacturers rather take the concept with commercial interest,
				to define the different generations of their processors.
				But one thing we must keep in mind is that all current desktop processors are based on the CISC or x86 architecture.
				What happens is that manufacturers make small modifications to this architecture,
				incorporating elements such as more cores, memory controllers, internal buses,
				cache memory of different types of processors, and so on,
				internal buses, cache memory of different levels, etc.
				Thus we hear names such as Coffee Lake, Skylake, Zen, Zen 2, etc.

			<p>
				Today we can distinguish between four types of architectures: CISC architecture
				(Complex Instruction Set Computer) or execution of a complex instruction,
				which forms the basis of all x86 or intel-compatible processors,
				RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture or executing a limited number of instructions,
				VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) architecture, and the more closely related EPIC (Explicit Parallel Instruction Computing).
				It should be noted that some products on the market may combine a number of these architecture models.

			<h3>
				<a id="Cisc">CISC Architecture</a>
			</h3>

			<p>
				CISC microprocessors have a very large instruction set that allows complex operations
				between operators located in memory or internal registers, as opposed to RISC architecture,
				which is capable of executing several hundred different complex instructions and is extremely versatile.
				This type of architecture makes it difficult to parallelize instructions,
				which is why today most high-performance CISC systems implement a system
				that converts these complex instructions into several simple RISC-type instructions, generally called microinstructions.
				CISCs belong to the first stream of processor construction, before the development of RISCs.
				Examples are: Motorola 68000, Zilog Z80 and all the Intel x86,
				AMD x86-64 family used in most of today's personal computers.
				It should be noted, however, that the use of the term CISC began after the
				appearance of RISC processors as a derogatory nomenclature by the latter's advocates/creators. See Retronym.

			<h3>
				<a id="Risc">RISC architecture</a>
			</h3>

			<p>
				In computer architecture, RISC is a type of CPU design generally used
				in microprocessors or microcontrollers with the following fundamental characteristics:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> Fixed-size instructions presented in a reduced number of formats. </li>
				<li> Only the load and store instructions access the data memory. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				In addition, these processors usually have many general purpose registers.
				The purpose of designing machines with this architecture is to enable segmentation
				and parallelism in the execution of instructions and to reduce memory accesses.
				RISC machines are at the forefront of the current trend in microprocessor construction.
				PowerPC, DEC Alpha, MIPS, ARM, SPARC are examples of some of them.
				RISC is a computer CPU design philosophy that favors small,
				simple instruction sets that take less time to execute. The most common type
				of processor used in desktop computers, the x86, is CISC-based rather than RISC-based,
				although newer versions translate x86 CISC-based instructions into
				simpler RISC-based instructions for internal use before execution.
				The idea was inspired by the fact that many of the features that were included in traditional
				CPU designs to increase speed were being ignored by the programs that were executed on them.
				In addition, the speed of the processor relative to the computer memory it was accessing was getting higher and higher.
				This led to the emergence of numerous techniques to reduce processing within the CPU,
				as well as to reduce the total number of memory accesses.
				More modern terminology refers to these designs as load-store architectures.

			<!-- VLIW -->
			<h3>
				<a id="Vliw">VLIW Architecture</a>
			</h3>

			<p>
				The very long instruction word (VLIW) CPU architecture implements a form of instruction-level parallelism.
				Similar to superscalar architectures, both use multiple functional units
				(e.g. multiple ALUs, multiple multipliers, etc.) to achieve this parallelism.
				Processors with VLIW architectures are characterized, as the name suggests,
				by having very simple instruction sets in terms of the number of different instructions,
				but very large in terms of the size of each instruction.
				This is because each instruction specifies the state of each and every functional unit of the system,
				with the aim of simplifying the hardware design by leaving all the work of code scheduling to the programmer/compiler,
				as opposed to a superscalar processor, where the hardware schedules the instructions at runtime.
			</p>
			<!-- FIN VLIW -->


			<!-- EPIC -->
			<h3>
				<a id="Epic">EPIC Architecture</a>
			</h3>

			<p>
				The EPIC (Explicit Parallel Instruction Computing) architecture uses both
				principles of superscalar architecture and parallel data processing.
				The 64-bit processors since the new Itanium generation, produced by Intel,
				have borrowed the EPIC architecture, more successful than ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism), jointly developed by HP and Intel.
				Unlike RISC technology, where the processor organizes the instruction sequences,
				in the EPIC model it is the compiler, which is responsible for optimizing
				the code in order to take advantage of parallel execution.
				In RISC processors, branch prediction is based on statistical behavior,
				justifying the solution by control over the instruction in the correct direction.
				The size of the error is 10 to 20 %, which leads to an increase in the execution
				time of a program and can be reduced if the optimization is performed according
				to a compiler-controlled algorithm and taking into account the previous execution
				as a whole instead of reacting based on past behavior.
				Thus, EPIC microprocessors calculate in parallel the different possibilities
				and the best one is saved afterwards. Therefore the controller controls separately
				the important so-called data flow (a process, allowing to optimize the order of data processing)
				in order to control all calculations in parallel, without speed loss.

				Relatively recently Intel released its new range of processors, the intel-12000,
				which are created with a new manufacturing process, Intel 7.
				This fact is especially noteworthy considering that for a few years now
				Intel has only been implementing slight improvements, but in this case it
				surprised with its new hybrid architecture, as Apple was already using with the Intel 7 series.

				In computer architecture, RISC is a type of CPU design generally used in
				microprocessors or microcontrollers with the following fundamental characteristics:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					P-Cores are large cores that offer high performance,
					but at the cost of being less energy efficient.
				</li>

				<li>
					E-Cores are smaller cores, which allows Intel to fit more
					cores in the same space and have lower power consumption.
				</li>
			</ul>

				This new architecture makes Intel processors able to compete in this
				range with Ryzen(amd) processors, which are currently considered the best in this price range.

			<p>
				On the other hand AMD has the Ryzen 5000 series, which bet on a Zen 3 architecture,
				which marks an important generational leap, in terms of IPC. According to tests,
				Ryzen would finally surpass Intel in single-threaded performance
				(the release of this series of processors was about a year ago), at present, with the new architecture used by Intel,
				this is no longer correct, but AMD has already planned the release of its new processors based on Zen 4.

				Finally, Apple is currently betting on the architecture already present in its M1 series of processors,
				which is a hybrid architecture. Using 5-nanometer process technology, featuring eight high-performance Firestorm cores and two
